          <h3>Katalyst Live</h3>
          <p>A known name in NYC tech scene is <a href="https://twitter.com/haithemnyc">Haithem Elembaby</a>. So when Haithem reached out to us to design a logo for his new venture, <a href="http://katalystlive.com">Katalyst Live</a> we were excited to work together. Haithem provided us with some ideas and guidelines for what his company represents, this gave  us some direction on the design.</p>

          <h2><span>Logo</span></h2>
          <p>Haithem is known for his amazing events that he puts on here in NYC. We figured that Katalyst would be an incredible company that would put on larger than life events with amazing experiences. The final version of their logo was inspired by two stage lights crossing paths, this representing Katalyst collaborating with the company they are working with.</p>

          <h2><span>Repeatable Patterns</span></h2>
          <p>After playing around with the logo we noticed that it had this really fun and playful pattern. We couldn't resist turning it into a wallpaper.</p>

        <p>Not only did we hand off a little presentation with the logo in uses, but we include all the assets they need to get started. A few weeks after they launched they noticed that they needed a smaller logo for their email signature. Without hesitation we sent this over to them.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Based on their track record we went in expecting Kennedy and Brian to deliver us with an awesome logo that would kick off our branding adventure and we came out with something even more awesome than we thought! Couldnâ€™t be happier with the final result and the fast process, in under a week we had a great logo &amp; branding to run with and give our business a strong start! &rdquo;</p>
