<p>Earlier this year, we started a project called <a href="http://kenvak.com">Kenvak</a>. We had a vision for a service that would make freelancers lives easier by handling the business side of things. Some of the services include; preparing invoices, drafting contracts, vetting leads, and collecting money. Having a similar business plan, Justin from Working Not Working reached out to us wanting to meet up for drinks. All three of us meet at the SoHo house to discussed business and we instantly hit it off.</p>

<p>The second weekend of December is renown for company holiday parties and overall madness in the city. There was no exception this year for us. The fine people over at <a href="http://workingnotworking.com/">Working Not Working</a>, <a href="http://workingnotworking.com/adam">Adam</a> &amp; <a href="http://workingnotworking.com/justin">Justin</a>, extended an invite to all of their freelancers who are a part of the WNW community. There were wrapped presents, plenty of delicious snacks, and drinks were flowing. If you want to throw a badass company holiday party, you should model it off the WNW party. Fun photo booths, professional photography meandering amongst the crowd, free gifts, and awesome food are all part of the ingredients of a holiday party that will go down in the history books.</p>

<p>We want to give a special thanks to Working Not Working. If it wasn't for our latest project that came through their site Theron Studios may very well have died. WNW literally saved our asses and our business, and for that we will be forever grateful.
