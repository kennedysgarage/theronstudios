<h3>Hey good looking.</h3>
<p>Most recently we’ve redesigned some really cool sites, one of which was for the father of a really great guy Scott Smedresman, who happens to be our lawyer. He referred us to his father Steven Smedresman, who also is a lawyer. He was looking to spruce up his existing website.</p>
<p>Steven was an ideal client, we showed him some examples of our previous work and he let us work our creative magic with almost no guidelines. Steven was quite pleased with the finished result. http://smedresmanlaw.com/  And so were we.</p>
<h3>So whats next for us now?</h3>
<p>Theron Studios plans to offer a limited number of startups a really cool and new concept of a PTCTO.  You may be asking yourself, “what’s a PTCTO?” A PTCTO is a part time chief technical officer. We are offering 2-3 companies who want help navigating through the treacherous terrain of the technical side of things. We have solidified 2 companies so far, and have space for 1-2 more.</p>
<p>Another idea that we were playing around with was Theron Hotels. Theron Hotels was an idea that came to us when we saw the disparity between hotel rates and Airbnb daily rates. We researched 100’s of US cities to find the greatest disparity &amp; the most opportunity for profit. The idea has iterated a few times in the past month and we are now working on a dashboard for short term rental guests and hosts to use.</p>
<p>Theron Studios has experienced a few major road bumps in the past few months, from nightmarish clients to medical injuries to a close friends parent passing away. But we’ve persevered. No one said the journey of an entrepreneur was an easy one. We continue to press forward pushing each other to stay focus and to constantly learn. Kennedy has been working on some wireframes for an Android app and we hope to finish the project this week. We can’t wait to share the finished product with everyone.</p>
<p>We've made a ton of mistakes, but we are learning from them.</p>
