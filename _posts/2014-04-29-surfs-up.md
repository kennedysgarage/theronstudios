<p>Hello Good Looking,</p>
<p>To make a tall story short, Kennedy and Brian are childhood friends that grew up together. They also caused a bit of trouble going against the norm. Years later, they are still stuck together working harder than ever.</p>
<p>Keeping this simple, we have no clue what we are doing but we love what we are trying to do. With that in mind it's not going to be easy, but we are not doing this because it's easy. We are doing it because it's hard, no wait, because we actually enjoy what we do.</p>
<p>Our goal is try to stay focused and look past random possible opportunity. We believe in creating real value to our customers and helping them grow their brand using innovative strategies and beautiful design.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br/> Team Theron</p>

<p><small>P.S. If you don't want to hire us for our creative chops, we are also great surf instructors.</small></p>
