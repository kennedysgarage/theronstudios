<p><a href="http://theronstudios.com/">Theron Studios</a> is proud to be a part of the First Class of startups to embark on this amazing journey. Theron Studios was one of the lucky 18 companies selected by <a href="https://twitter.com/mbharrigan">Matt Harrigan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CVBonello">Charles Bonello</a>. Approximately 500 NYC startups applied to utilize <a href="http://www.grandcentraltech.com/">Grand Central Tech</a>'s accelerator program which features "0% equity &amp; $0 rent" for a year.</p>
<p>The startups at GCTech will occupy Facebook's former sales and marketing office space (15,000 square feet) which is directly across from Grand Central Terminal. We are excited to call GCTech home.</p>

<p>It has been a roller coaster ride over the past couple months for Theron Studios co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/KennedysGarage">Kennedy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/btrevak">Brian Revak</a>. Kennedy, who <a href="http://kennedysgarage.com/articles/goodbye-google/">recently left Google</a>, and Brian, who is relatively new to the tech world, are adapting nicely and are excited to learn from the mentors and strategists that help make up the GCTech team. We are thrilled to work along some of our friends including <a href="https://twitter.com/gillianim">Gillian Morris</a> of <a href="http://www.hitlistapp.com/">Hitlist</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wrmayo">Will Mayo</a> of <a href="http://www.spokenlayer.com/#voice">Spoken Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Central Tech has assembled a truly innovative group of partners to ensure the companies receive the best advice from the broadest and richest range of inputs. They have gathered an experienced and connected Strategic Advisory Board, selected Mentors and Mentor Companies that have been there before, identified a broader network of interested VCs and Angels, reached out to Corporate Sponsors and Growth Partners, and gained access to some of New York’s most amazing schools (not to mention their alumni and parent networks who represent an incredibly diverse range of practitioner level experience).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We're creating a community where tech becomes an engine for growth that a lot of different people can benefit from - by bringing in area high schools so young people can be exposed to tech, and bringing in corporate partners so that they’re not exclusively disrupted by startups.&rdquo;</p>
