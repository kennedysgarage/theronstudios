					<p>Based in New York, and operating from Grand Central Tech's awesome accelerator; Theron Studios is comprised of 2 really tall guys. Kennedy,who stands at 6'6'' is an ex-Googler, and an award winning designer with a keen eye for detail. Brian, standing tall at 6'5'' handles the business side of the operations and keeps Theron focused.</p>

					<p>Originally from a small town in Florida, Kennedy and Brian grew up together and worked as lifeguards for Flagler Beach Ocean Rescue. At an early age Kennedy and Brian both embodied an entreprenuerial spirit. They sold burned cds and surf stickers on the bus to their peers in middle and high school.</p>

					<p>Their paths in life diverged after college for a few years. But after a trip up to New York in late 2013, Brian visited  Kennedy and they rekindled their business talks and formed Theron Studios shortly after.</p>
